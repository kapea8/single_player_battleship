# single_player_battleship

This is a single player battleship game that I coded in Intro to CS 1. The code for placing the ships was provided by my professor, and the rest was done by me.
The game is played in the terminal on a 4x4 board and each space on the board is marked with a dash, "M", or "H".
A dash represents an unguessed space, "M" represents a miss, and "H" represents a hit.
Once the user sinks a ship, a message will print to the terminal alerting them of such.
The user wins if they sink all the ships within the given number of guesses and a win/lose message will be printed accordingly.
